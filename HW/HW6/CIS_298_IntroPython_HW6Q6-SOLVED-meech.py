#Question 6 (from hw5 question 10) - Make it work.  Then make it better.
 
#Here is my original solution from hw5, question 10
def even_nums_MySol_1():
    for number in range(1000, 3001, 2): # range [1000, 3001] and only return a number every 2 values (step = 2)
        print(number, ', ', end = '')
#note: range function returns an iterable list with only even numbers based on the parameters I passed to the function
#even_nums_MySol_1() #call my function


#From Professor: 
#In grading homework 5 I noticed a variety of solutions 
#to question 10 (print all numbers between 1000 and 3000,inclusive, where each digit is even). 
#I appreciate questions like this for it allows me to see a range of thinking on how to solve a problem.  

#Here are two solutions that were given:

#Solution 1:
#print(*[n for n in range(1000, 3001) if all([(int(c) % 2 == 0) for c in str(n)])], sep=',')

#Solution 2:
#numbers = []
#for i in range(1000, 3001):
#    is_even = True
#    for j in str(i):
#        if int(j) %2 == 1:
#            is_even = False
#    if is_even:
#        numbers.append(i)
#print(numbers)



#The second solution takes more coding but essentially does the same thing.  
#Part of writing software (or doing analysis, at least) is identifying patterns of what needs to be done.  
#Making a problem generic can sometimes help in this regard (find numbers between x and y, etc.).  
#Looking at a problem in a different way (thinking outside of the box) can provide a unique solution as well. 
#One thing to always remember is that just because something is a number doesn't mean it has to be treated as a number.  
#Think of phone numbers or social security numbers. 
#While they contain only digits, one almost never performs mathematical operations against them 
#so they could just as easily be strings, and probably should be.

#The two solutions above are more efficient than examining every number between 1000 (or x) and 3000 (or y), 
#but they could be more efficient yet.  Think about what problem we're trying to solve.  
#The first solution is probably a good one, but is there a better one?  If the 10's position contains an odd number, 
#does it matter what the digit is in the one's position? No, so we should move to the next 10's position value. 
#The same holds true for 100's and 1000's positions.

#Q6.1[10 pts]. Determine how to time programs in Python.
#   A) Run 3 tests of each of the first two solutions given above 
#       and average the results.  

def even_nums_sol_1():
    print(*[n for n in range(1000, 3001) if all([(int(c) % 2 == 0) for c in str(n)])], sep=',')

#even_nums_sol_1()

def even_nums_sol_2():
    numbers = []
    for i in range(1000, 3001):
        is_even = True
        for j in str(i):
            if int(j) %2 == 1:
                is_even = False
        if is_even:
            numbers.append(i)
    print(numbers)

#even_nums_sol_2()


#   B) Come up with a solution that is more efficient (faster). 
#       Run 3 tests on it and record the average. 
#   C) Supply your faster algorithm and the average result of all three algorithms.





#Q6.22[50]. Deep dive into logically cutting corners in a solution through analysis. 
#Find a solution to this problem that executes in under 1 second (can it be even faster?) without hardcoding the answer.
#Displaying values takes a long time so remove most output statements once youâ€™re getting close. 
#I'll spare you the long version of the question. 
#Simply do this: find the price of four items who's sum and who's product both equal 7.11.  So, a+b+c+d == a*b*c*d == 7.11.  
#There may be more than one answer.  I originally solved this problem 37 years ago (in C). My initial algorithm ran for over 12 hours.  
#My deep dive analysis produced one that solved it in about 1 second.  Supply your final algorithm and how long it takes to solve the problem.

#Find the price of four items who's sum and who's product both equal to 7.11.
#So, a+b+c+d == a*b*c*d == 7.11


#I found from my analysis that using range of number from [5,0) yields a fast result since solutions seem to be very small numbers.
#thus, that is why I make default upper and lower range to be 5, 0 respectively. Precision is 2 by default because of problem requirements.

    ):
        #So after further analysis, I realize I can simplify the problem!
        #let c and d be any (random) number, then the problem is simplified from:
        #now generate 2 random values (we will use range (0,100]) that will be used)
        #set negative range = 0 since prices of items must be nonzero
        c = get_randmon_num(positive_range=upper_range,negative_range=lower_range)
        d = get_randmon_num(positive_range=upper_range,negative_range=lower_range)
            #abcd=7.11 and a+b+c+d=7.11 
            #to ab*c*d = 7.11 and a+b+c+d = 7.11, where c and d are known (chosen/selected).
            #which simplifies to: ab=7.11/cd and a+b=7.11-(c+d)
            #thus we simply need to solve a system of equations for terms a and b:
                #EQUATION_1: a = (7.11/cd)/b, 
                #EQUATION_2: a = 7.11 - (c+d) - b 
            #--> (7.11/cd)/b = 7.11 - (c+d) - b

            #--> b^2 + (c+d-7.11)b + (7.11/cd) = 0
            #now solve using quadratic formula: x = (-c2 (+/-) sqrt[c2^2 -4*c1*C]) / 2*c1,

            # solution 2 for b: (  - (c+d-7.11) (-) sqrt[(c+d-7.11)^2 - 4*1*(7.11/cd)]  ) / (2*1)
        #once we use one of the solutions for b, we simply plug in b's value to any one of our system equations to solve for a
        #We first need to do a special check on the discriminant D = c2^2-4*c1*C :
            #if D < 0, then sqrt(c2^2-4*c1*C) will be a complex number since it will take sqrt of a negative number (complex solution);
            #if D > 0, then there are two real roots (thus 2 real number solution)
            #if D == 0, then there is one real root (thus one real number solution)
        #A simpler way of saying this is that if c2^2 < 4*c1*C, then sqrt(c2^2-4*c1*C) will be a complex number;
            #thus, we need to check for this and skip this loop since values chosen for c and d will produce complex solutions:
