#Submit your code in a report: question number, code copy/pasted, snippet of output.

 

#You may answer all questions in one program but only submit the code for that question, separately from any other code. 

#****** Lists has 3 questions, tuples has 3 questions, dictionary has 8 questions. ******

#* Lists []

#Create an empty list and print the list

#Create a singleton list and print the list

#Create a list of 5 items of mixed types and print the list

#Print the 3rd item in the list

#Print the item at index -3

#Change the 3rd item in the list to “bye” and print the whole list

#Change the -4th item in the list to ‘hello’ and print the whole list

#Print the length of the list

#Find the min and max of the list

#Delete the -5th item in the list

#Add list [‘heaven’, -986] to the beginning of your list

#Append list [‘abc’,1,”ABC” ] to the end of your list

#Add ‘hello’ to the end of your list.  What happened?

#Append “world” to the end of your list. What happened?

#Print your list, perform pop() on your list, and print the list again

#Perform pop(4) on your list and print the list

#Perform pop(-2) on your list and print the list

#Print the length of your list as a float

#Print the type and ord of your list

 

 

#* Tuples ()

#Create an empty tuple and print the tuple

#Create a singleton tuple and print the tuple

#Create a tuple of 5 items of mixed types and print the tuple

#Print the 3rd item in the tuple

#Print the item at index -3

#Change the 3rd item in the tuple to “bye” and print the whole tuple

#Change the -4th item in the tuple to ‘hello’ and print the whole tuple

#Print the length of the tuple

#Find the min and max of the tuple

#Delete the -5th item in the tuple

#Add tuple [‘heaven’, -986] to the beginning of your tuple

#Append tuple [‘abc’,1,”ABC” ] to the end of your tuple

#Add ‘hello’ to the end of your tuple.  What happened?

#Append “world” to the end of your tuple. What happened?

#Print your tuple, perform pop() on your tuple, and print the tuple again

#Perform pop(4) on your tuple and print the tuple

#Perform pop(-2) on your tuple and print the tuple

#Print the length of your tuple as a float

#Print the type and ord of your tuple

 

 

#* Dict { }

#Build a dictionary with 6 college & mascot associations, using all three methods

#                A = { key : value, key : value }

#      A = dict( [(key, value), (key,value)] )

#                A=dict( key=value, key=value )

#Access the dictionary using a key that doesn’t exist

#Add a new value to the dictionary and print the dictionary

#Change the value of an existing entry and print the dictionary

#Del an entry from the dictionary

#Check to see if a value is ‘in’ the dictionary and also ‘not in’ the dictionary

#Get the length of the dictionary

#Print a list of sorted keys to the dictionary
